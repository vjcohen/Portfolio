            <h2>A Photoshop Introduction Piece</h2>
            <h3>Finalized: Sep 8/2021</h3>
            <img src="imgs/Victor Cohen-Good Attempt.psd.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              This was my first attempt at Photoshopping my face and other
              objects into a picture. There is a bat in the statues hand, a hot
              dog and baseball at the base of the statue. Along with my self at
              the left side of the picture. Finally a painting of Babe Ruth in
              the portrait behind the statue. This piece shows I know how to
              worked photoshop and show I can learn new things so I can help
              make my clien more money. My audience for this piece was no one in
              particular just for myself to test and see if I could work
              photoship well.

            <h2>A Fake Advert</h2>
            <h3>Finalized: Sep 22/2021</h3>
            <img src="imgs/Victor Cohen-Final Advert.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              This one I had to make a fake, comedic, advert. This one I added a
              dolphin jumping out of the soup, a fish swimming in the soup, a
              octopus tentacle coming out of the soup, and finally I added a
              shark fin. I had to make it so these objects looked apart of the
              picture. Than making up a funny text, which you can see in the
              picture. The value would increase for a clien because I can work
              on photoshop and improve my skills in it if needed. My audience
              for this one was to have it so if I was to apply to work at a
              advert company, I can mix comedy into my work to gain a bigger
              audience.

            <img src="imgs/Eyes2.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              This is another Photoshop project I had to do. I had to color over
              my eyes very well that it had to look like a painted version of my
              eyes. This one was really difficult and took a lot of time, but in
              the end I just couldn't figure out how to blend all the colors
              well. For a client this would be valuable because it shows I can
              pain in photoshop to a exstent, with enough time I could really
              make good art, instead of this one. My main audience would have to
              be the art community to show I could potentially draw my face in
              photoshop.

            <h3>Finalized: Oct 20/2021</h3>
            <img src="imgs/Personal-Logo.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              Instead of using photoshop for this project, I had to use Adobe
              Illustrator to create my logos. I had to make ten logos of my
              choice, it was a free create project. You can see I created many
              different logos, some based off video games, others that I came up
              with randomly, and a few references to shows. This can help value
              my cliet because it shows I can work with different types of
              drawings/styles so I can make big or small. My main audience for
              this was for companies who are looking for new logos.

            <h2>Crest</h2>
            <h3>Finalized: Nov 3/2021</h3>
            <img src="imgs/VictorC_Crest2.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              This project I had to make was a family crest. I had to make a
              crest that represent my family and I. I used animals to represent
              some attributes/characteristics I see in myself, with their (close
              enough looking) Environment behind them. In the center is a heart
              with a small reference to my family's actual crest. With a heart
              at the core stating that my family means a lot. This could value a
              client because it shows I can make busy art pieces. My auidence
              was my family as a crest to them and how I view my family.

            <h3>Finalized: Nov 17/2021</h3>
            <img src="imgs/VictorCohen-Character.jpg" alt="" />
            <p>
              This is my most recent project that I had to make. This time I had
              to make my own character from all the skills and principles of
              design I was taught in class to make a character of my own
              creation. In my final decision I made a mushroom knight with a
              soldier like appearance but with a warm heart. I spent many hours
              on this project because I liked this one the most. This can value
              my client because it shows I can also make characters and make
              them look like they have life to them. My audience was for any
              company looking for a orginal character with some personality to
              them.

            <h2>Website 1</h2>
            <h3>Finalized: Sep 28/2021</h3>

            /></a>
            <p>
              This is the first website I had to make. Its very simple and
              doesn't contain a lot, I just had to position things and size them
              accordingly. How this would be valuable to a client, would be
              because it shows if needed I can work on coding for websites. My
              intended audience would be companies looking for people who know
              how to code websites.

            /></a>
            <p>
              This is the second demo website I had to make . It was a bit more
              difficult than the last one but fairly simple. This took a bit
              more time but not a lot of time. This is valuable to a client
              because it shows I can improve my skills in coding thus I can work
              on my difficult tasks if needed. My attended audience again would
              be website coding companies like the prior work.

            /></a>
            <p>
              For this one I had to make a more complex website, it was based
              off a website outline I had seen before. I had to copy it exactly,
              even though mine looks almost like the one I saw but not all the
              way. I just didn't understand how to position things correctly so
              I had to use alternative methods to get it looking like it. This
              is valuable to a client because it shows I can work with a draft
              and make it look pretty profesional looking. My intented audience
              for this one was coding companies for websites and also people who
              are looking for layouts.

            /></a>
            <p>
              This was a really complicated website I had to make. I had to,
              again, copy a outline website our teacher gave us. This was a
              really difficult one that took, in my opinion, the longest time I
              have spent on making a website. Once again I had to use my own
              methods to get it to look exactly like the one he wanted us to
              copy. This is valuable to a client because it shows even though I
              may not understand coding a website completely I can work with
              these conditions and find a way to get what I want it to look
              like. My audience for this project would be companies who are
              looking for someone who is capable of coding a website with very
              little experience and is willing to try it.
