          <h2>Highschool & Background</h2>
          <p>
            I was born in Guatemala originally. I am adopted though and was
            raised in America, more specifically I was raised in the state of
            Illinois, in a small town called Lake Forest. I also have one
            brother who was also adopted from Guatemala, but we are not blood
            related. I graduated from LFHS (Lake Forest HighSchool), with
            average grades.

          <h2>What I did after Highschool</h2>
          <p>
            After Highschool I thought about taking a gap year so I could relax
            but instead I chose to go to college so I could pursue my dreams. I
            originally thought I would be studying at UWSTOUT, but that school
            just wasn't for me. I only stayed there for one semester, after that
            I went to CLC (College of Lake County) to finish up my first year in
            college. Once that was over I enrolled at
            <a href="https://www.iupui.edu/">IUPUI</a> because I found it suited
            me better.

          <h2>Goal in college and why</h2>
          <p>
            My goal in college as now while in my second year is to learn new
            skills in game design and digital art. That is because I have always
            enjoyed playing video games and had a dream of making one of my own
            one day that will become main stream. I have always loved to draw or
            create art digitally ever since I was young, so I want to enhance my
            skill of creating art/drawings while at IUPUI.

          <h1>What I want to do after college</h1>
          <p>
            After college I really have no idea on what I want to do with my
            future. The only thing I know for sure is that I want to take a year
            off to do my own thing and figure out life. I may jump right into
            working for some gaming company. One thing for sure is I want to
            take some time off and try my hand on streaming on twitch for a
            year. Eventually though I want to create a huge game that will go
            viral around the world.

          These are two of three dogs I have currently. The dog on the left of
          the German(Or Belgian, we don't know) shepherd is named Pearl. The
          other dog is named Tulip. Even though they may look friendly in this
          picture they are always in each others business for no reason.
